                    <p>Kia ora whanau, my name is Brian Yu and I was born on the 14th of October 2008. Currently, I am 14 and a student in the Sir Peter Blake Whanau of Botany Downs Secondary College. I live together with my parents and a little sister who is 12 and goes to Somerville Intermediate. My hobbies include playing tennis and gaming in my spare time.  One of my goals is to take part in a successful job and have a steady income so that I’m able to travel the world with my friends and family. At home I speak a mixture of Mandarin and English with my parents. Both of them were born in Taiwan and moved to New Zealand around the 1990’s. We celebrate Christmas and Easter and the many others but we also celebrate Chinese New Year with my grandparents where we come together and share a meal  which includes tons of delicious foods with recipes from Taiwan. </p> <!-- This is a paragraph about my culture and my personal life -->
