                    <p>I am proficient in multiple sports such as tennis, basketball, and badminton. In life, I try to have an even balance between work and enjoyment so that I can study hard but also have fun at the same time. I think this is quite important and has allowed to get where I am in my life right now. Having a balance in life has paid off as I have received multiple awards in my 10 years at school such as Year 9 Academic Honour Roll and 4 Academic Excellences in a range of Learning areas such as English, Japanese, Mathematics, and Science. I have a lot of unique and interesting characteristics but some of my strongest characteristics include my mentality,    such as the fact that I never give up in the face of adversity. Another one of my characteristics include my work ethic, and my determination which helps me to complete all my work to a high standard as well as finishing it on time as well because of my excellent planning skills and efficiency. In regards to my personality, I am a very happy student and never have a negative attitude no matter whatâ€™s happening I always try to remain positive and think calmly and do every thing precisely.</p> <!-- This is a paragraph of Skills -->
